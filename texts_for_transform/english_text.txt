Your sister wants to see you.
She insisted on going there.
I wish I were in Spain now.
I'm very busy so don't count on me.
I want to be a singer.
Give me something to write on.
Have you found any good solution?
I like to run
You want to read
You make it very well
They wash every day
He thinks about you
A man works in the field
We plan to get back soon
We are not waiting for you
I used to come here every day
I did love you!
She doesn't plan to leave
He ordered me to leave
She told me to stay there
She told me not to stay there
He doesn't want to swim
We will not buy a new car unless we sell the old one
I have learned it from my old friend
He has bought it already
Yesterday by 3 I had already finished my job
If you had done your work well,  I would have not fired you.
Have you already completed your job?
Have you ever been to London?
He has never been to Russia
She hasn't finished yet
They haven't yet arrived
He has been very helpful these days
I've been thinking about you
He's been trying to get it
I had already solved this problem by the time you came
By 5 I will already have written this article
He left smoking his thick cigar
She stood laughing in the rain
We sat there looking at this thick man
He left having finished this job
He never lies
She loves nobody
She does nothing to help me
Don't touch anything
She doesn't go anywhere
I didn't meet anyone
She will not talk to any stranger
He left without saying a word
She never loved anybody
I didn't touch anything anywhere
I didn't give anything to anyone
He neither drink, nor smoke
Do neither this, nor that
Don't mix vodka and beer
Don't tell him to do this
Tell her not to do this
Never trust  a pretty face
Don't take anything
Let's not dance
Let me not go
Don't let him grasp you
Don't let her mock you
Don't make me regret about it
Don't make him pay
Don't make us cry
Don't make your parents regret about it
Be there
Don't be so stupid
Don't be afraid.
Could you see her yesterday?
Could you do me a favor?
Will she be able to learn English?
We can't stay here any longer
The cannot arrive that soon
He couldn't say anything
I wouldn't be able to deceive people
She won't be able to come in time
He  has to get you home
You have to sell the car
You have to leave tomorrow
You had to come at once
She had to wait for him
I'll have to inform him
You'll have to write to us
The'll have to pay
She was to go there
They are not going to read
He was not going to run
You need a new girlfriend
He needs some sun
We need pens
She needs money
I needed a lawyer
She needed shoes
He doesn't need any acountant
She doesn't need any lovers
Shal we dance
I won't need a lawyer
She won't need any loan
I need to leave in the morning
You need to sleep for 2 hours
She needs to be kissed
We needed to go
You'll need to come here
We didn't need to steal it
They won't need to run away
He doesn't need to leave today
I may not come back alone
He may not speak English
If you gave me some money, I would buy a car.
We may not swim here
Let's go to the cinema
Let's dance
There will be many tables in the room
Last year there was a house here
In the summer there will be many people here
Was there a house here last summer?
Will there be any shop here?
There is no money in my pocket
There isn't any money in my pocket
There was nothing int the room
There never was a pool here
There is a house there
She wouldn' do it
It would be great if you were here
We'd buy a car if we had money
If I were you I wouldn't go there
Neither would I!
I want him to make this
He wants her to come here
I want the child to play
I don't want the children to play
You don't want me to know
He wants us to know
We wanted him to know
She doesn't want you to live
I think she knows him
He supposes that you saw him
We hoped you would come
She knew that we wouldn't come back
They will think that you've done it
I saw her dance
I saw her dancing
I saw him shake your hand
She feels him touch her
I thought it was you
She thought it to be great
I asked what his name was
I told him he was allowed to do this
I read that drinking is not good for health
We didn't know what time the film usually begins
I know he said it
I will never believe he said such a thing
I have heard he is coming back
I'd rather pay then leave
I'd rather leave than stay
You'd better pay
She'd better obey
I'd better go
Usually I drink no beer
We used to come here every Sunday
He used to wash his car here
I used to smoke very much
Last year they used to call us every day
They used to hunt here before his death
I shouldn't do it
I should go
You should behave properly
She should obey
You should go and take a walk
Should we really leave this place?
Shouldn't he shut up?
I was told the truth
You were said to be missing
He was given a difficult task
The platoon was ordered to attack
We were informed about this event
They are being tutored every day
She will be taught to swim
I will be listened to
He likes to swim
He likes to travel
We like the way you work
They like us
I liked those dolls
My children will like this teddy-bear
I like no apples    I don't like apples
They won't like it
I like the way she dances
She likes the way he moves
It seemed to him she let him down
It seems to me he is fighting
You should be sent away
He should be checked
You should be hanged
They should be preserved
The table should be cleared
The hair should be cut shorter
I'm beaten every time I enter that bar
He is very much spoken about
We are punished very often
He was caressed by everyone
The tree was cut with an axe
The music was performed very well
You were followed by a tail
She will be brougth there
We will be treated like kings
That book is being written now
The car is being washed right now
I was given to the cannibals
I was given
Is he to be blamed?
I must be instructed
They have to be fed up
They don't have to be fed up
She has to be sent away
She doesn't have to be sent away
We had to be taught to fly
We didn't have to be taught to fly
We are said to spend a lot of money
We are said to have spent a lot of money
He was seen to fall
She was heard to cry
He was thought to disappear
We were noticed to kiss
They will be said to drink
I'm supposed to be absent
You are supposed to disappear
He's supposed to return
They are supposed to call us
He isn't supposed to return
We are not supposed to be late
I was supposed to be healthy
I was not supposed to be healthy
She was supposed to regret
They will be supposed to fight back
"There is a necessity of our coming
There is a necessity for us to come
There is a necessity that we should come"
She shouldn't do it again
You should go and take it by force
She wouldn't wash dishes
They wouldn't get out
He wouldn't give up
We wouldn't make friends with her
You seem to be afraid
She seems to be crying
He seems to have gone
We seemed to be hungry
We seemed to be lost
I wish I could fly
I wish I could buy this car
If I only could buy this car
If I only could get him back
If he only could imagine
Why should I read this book?
Why should I let him insult me?
Why should we dance?
Why should she retire?
How could I meet you?
How could you get the money?
How could he catch her?
How could she avoid this?
How could we get out from here?
How could we find them?
How could the find us?
What should I do to make her love me?
What else can I do but confess?
What else can she do but stay?
What else can we do but leave?
How can I make her come back?
How could I make her come back?
How will I be able to make her come back?
What can I do to make her come back?
Why is your passport here?
If my work is hard, I will not do it.
What has he to do to make her come back?
What had he to do to make her come back?
It would be wonderful if she came here
Who is listening to the tape?
It would be splendid if you were smarter
Which of the children is going to the Zoo on Sunday?
It would be tremendous if you won
It would be fabulous if they got married
We quit without paying the bill
Tomorrow by three we will have washed these dishes
By this time I have already bought that car
By the time you came he had already painted…
The man I saw yesterday was very tall
They laughed at what he said
Here is the man I'm thinking about
And where is the dog he's travelling with?
There is a red phone on the bed
When are your parents′ birthdays?
Whose passport is this?
Who is a teacher?
Where is my mother from?
How old is our grandfather?
If you buy me a car, I will marry you
