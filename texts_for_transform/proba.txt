The Moscow underground transportation system is the deepest one in the world. My story starts in Moscow. I was 15 years old. My best friend and I, we were part of a group of Westerners. We visiting the Soviet Union. This was in 1987, a few years before the fall of the communist regime. We were given an official tour guide who was assigned to us. And the tour would start in the morning. and we were checked in to our hotel rooms for the night. My friend said to me, Let's go outside and look at the city.
I thought it was a great idea.
